# Post notes
- Make sure you use the same scale as the training data as you did in the holdout with normalization. 
- Date feature to day of week function, make sure to do it the same way in the holdout 
- use functions more! Cells shouldn't act like functions. 
- use the keras tuner and 
keras_tuner.HyperParameters() <- Use this. 
- Take advantage of people having written libraries. 
- Image recognition -> There are already some really good Convolutional Neural Networks that have already been built. 
- Don't use r2 on training 
- Chose a month for validation on this set.
